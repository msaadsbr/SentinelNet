# 🛡️ SentinelNet

**SentinelNet** is a lightweight, intelligent, machine learning-based tool that detects suspicious network behavior in real time — like a mini antivirus for your network.

Built using Python, trained on the **UNSW-NB15** dataset, and deployed via a **Streamlit web app**, it helps users determine whether a network session is normal or an attack.
